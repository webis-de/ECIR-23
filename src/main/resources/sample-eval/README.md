# Sample Eval

This script contains sample_eval.pl that can be downloaded from: https://trec.nist.gov/data/medical/12/sample_eval.pl
This script contains an implementation of infNDCG. I copied this script to `sample_eval_depth_10.pl` where I adopted the maxResultSize to 10 so that we calculate infNDCG@10.
